## Project Description

[Project Page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability/): Kaggle competition to predict the probability that a client will default on a loan.

In one word, the goal of this project is to predict the probability that a client will default on a loan. The submission file should contain variables for the `case_id` and the `score` which is the probability that the client will default on a loan. The `score` should be between 0 and 1.
